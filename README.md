This is the (uncompleted) thesis work of Alexander Long.
You will need to create a virtual enviroment for python scripting in the "venv" folder. This is done with:
```
cd DensityScattering
python3 -m venv venv
source bin/activate
pip3 install nucdens
pip3 install tables
```
In the future perhaps we will use a more robust method but this works for now.

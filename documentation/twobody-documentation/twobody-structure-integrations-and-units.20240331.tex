\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}

An explanation of the twobody code structure with emphasis on integrations and
units.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Units}
\label{sec:units}


The "mantle" code has base unit $\fm$ (but NOT the output
file/\texttt{Result()}, see below!):

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \texttt{p12, p12p} & momenta in $\fm^{-1}$\\
  \texttt{rho}       & 2N density in $\fm^3$ (quantum numbers per volume
                       momentum space)\\
  \texttt{k}        &photon omentum/energy still given in $\MeV$
\end{tabular}

However, in \texttt{finalstatesums.twobodyvia2Ndensity.f}, the call

\hqqq         \texttt{call
  Calculate2BIntegralI2(...,p12*HC,P12MAG(ip12p)*HC,...)}

converts the momenta from $\fm^{-1}$ to $\MeV$. That subroutine is defined in \texttt{calculate2BI2.f}.
Therefore, that routine and the subsequent "kernel" parts of the code use base
unit $\MeV$:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \texttt{calculate2BI2.f}&\\
  \texttt{2Bkernel.*.f} & part of "kernel", specific to process\\
  \texttt{2Bspinsym.*.f}         & part of "kernel", specific to process\\
  \texttt{2Bspinasym.*.f}      & part of "kernel", specific to process
\end{tabular}
Therefore, the twobody "kernel diagrams" in these files are all using base
unit of $\MeV$.

\textbf{Output units:} The code is constructed such that if the kernel is
given in units of $MeV^{-n}$, then the variable \texttt{Result()} and its
output-to-file is in $\MeV^{(3-n)}$.

Multiplying by powers of $\texttt{HC}=197.\dots\;\MeV\fm$ translates into output of final MEs \texttt{Result()} into powers of $\fm$.

EXAMPLE: Compton has twobody kernel in $\MeV^{-4}$ ($n=4$), so the resultant
ME is in $\MeV^{-1}$. To convert to $\fm$, multiply by \texttt{HC}. In Compton, that multiplication by HC is not done in the fortran code, but
later in the mathematica processing files.

EXAMPLE: Pion Photoproduction kernel has units $\MeV^{-2}$ if the output
should be the twobody functions $F_{TL}$. Therefore,  $n=-2$ and the
\texttt{Results()} output is in $\MeV^1$. But the $F_{TL}$ output should be in $\fm^{-1}$, so divide here in kernel by \texttt{HC} to get $\fm^{-1}$ units in \texttt{Results()}.

Routines which compute vectors, like \texttt{calcmomenta.f}, simply use the same base unit in and out, i.e. are "unit neutral".
 
Therefore, the overall units of the output are $\MeV^{3-n}$ for a kernel with base units $\MeV^{-n}$!

The conversion $\frac{(\texttt{HC})^3}{(2\pi)^3}$ above is programmed
in \texttt{finalstatesums.twobodyvia2Ndensity.f}'s "fact=...") and converts
between the $\fm$ units of the "mantle" and the $\MeV$ units of the "kernel".

It ALSO includes ONE of the Fourier volumes $\frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}$ as a factor of
the twobody integration. There is no second Fourier volume (killed by phase
space). This guarantees that onebody and twobody have the same size and can
simply be summed to get the total amplitude:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:addamps}
  \mbox{amplitude } = \mbox{ onebody } + \mbox{ twobody }\;\;,
\end{equation}
without any relative factors (provided both provide output in same base
units). However, \emph{to include this factor or not depends on your choice of
  twobody kernel}.

That means in pion photoproduction, one may instead define it as part of the
prefactor \texttt{K2n} of a diagram. This implies that if you want the twobody
\texttt{Result()} output to be $F_{TL}$, you must un-compensate it here by
\texttt{*(2*Pi)**3}. On the other hand, if you want the twobody
\texttt{Result()} output to be $E_+$ etc., so that you can simply add as in
eq.~\eqref{eq:addamps} above, then the prefactor \texttt{K2n} shouldNOT
contain the $\frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}$, i.e.~multiply NOT with
\texttt{*(2*Pi)**3/HC}, but with
\begin{equation}
  \texttt{K2n = sqrt(4*Pi*alpaEM)*gA*mpi**2/(16*Pi*fpi**3)*10**3}
\end{equation}
to get \texttt{Result()} in the canonical units of $10^{-3}\;m_{\pi+}^{-1}$.
 
Set your kernel up in \texttt{2Bkernel.*.f} so that your \texttt{Result()} has the desired units and factors of $(2\pi)^3$. Do NOT make unit changes outside this file!

\section{Integration Coding}
\label{sec:integration}

\subsection{Overall Structure}
\label{sec:integration-structure}

The integral is symbolically (including the permutation factor already
in the code itself, and denoting on the left the units of each line):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:twobody}
  \begin{split}
    [\MeV]^{3-n}\hqq&\;\genfrac{(}{)}{0pt}{}{A}{2}\;
    \bra\wfbra \sep M ' \, | O_{12} | \wf \sep M \, \ket \equiv\\

    \sum_{\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\fs\texttt{mt12,j12,s12,l12,m12}}{\fs

  \sum_{\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\fs
      \texttt{\pbox{\linewidth}{\hf mt12p=mt12\hf\\[-2ex]j12p,s12p,l12p\\[-2ex]\hf m12p,Mzp,Mz\hf}}}
    {\fs\text{in \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f}}}}
  \underbrace{\int\frac{\deint{}{p_{12}'} p_{12}^{\prime \, 2 }}{(2\pi)^3}\;\int
    \deint{}{p_{12}} p_{12}^{2}}_{\text{in \texttt{fact=\dots} of \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f}}}\;\\
  [\MeV\fm]^3\hqq&\hqqq\times
%  O_{12}^{\alpha_{12}' \alpha_{12}} (p_{12}', p_{12}) \;
  \texttt{HC}^3\hspace*{25ex}\mbox{in \texttt{fact=\dots} of \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f}}\\
  [\fm]^3\hqq&\hqqq\times\rho_{\alpha_{12}'\,\alpha_{12}}^{%M_{T},
    M'M} (p_{12}',p_{12};\qv)\hspace*{10.8ex}\mbox{in \texttt{fact=\dots} of \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f}}\\
  [\text{no units}]\hqq&\hqqq\times\hqmmm\hqmmm\hqmm\sum_{\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\fs
    \texttt{msp}\equiv m_{12}^{s\prime},\texttt{ms}\equiv m_{12}^s}{\fs\text{in \texttt{calculate2BI2.f}}}}
  \hspace*{-5ex}\CG{l_{12}'}{s_{12}'}{\jrel'}
  {m_{12}' - m^{s \prime }_{12}}{m^{s
      \prime}_{12}}{m_{12}'} \CG{l_{12}}{s_{12}}{\jrel}
  {m_{12} - m^{s}_{12}}{m^{s}_{12}}{m_{12}}   \hf\\[0.5ex]
  [\text{no units}]\hqq&\hqqq\hqqq\times \hqmmm\int\limits_{\fs\text{in \texttt{calculate2BI2.f}}} \hqmmm\deint{}{\hat p_{12}'} \deint{}{\hat p_{12}}
  Y^{\dagger}_{l_{12}' (m_{12}' - m^{s \prime }_{12})} ( \hat p_{12}') \;
  Y_{l_{12} (m_{12} - m^{s }_{12})} ( \hat p_{12})\; \\
  [\MeV]^{-n}\hqq&\hqqq\hqqq\hqqq\hqqq\times \underbrace{O_{12}^{\alpha_{12}'m_{12}^{s\prime} \alpha_{12}m_{12}^{s}} (\pv_{12}^{\,\prime},
    \pv_{12}; \qv )}_{\text{in \texttt{2Bkernel.*.f}}} \;\;.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\CG{j_{1}}{j_{2}}{j}{m_1}{m_{2}}{m}$ in
the convention of refs.~\cite{Edmonds, PDG}. The assignation of quantum
numbers between code and the quantities should be self-explaining except maybe
$\texttt{ms}=m_{12}^s$, $\texttt{msp}=m_{12}^{s\prime}$. The isospin
$\texttt{t12}=t_{12}^\prime$ is determined by the Pauli principle:
$(-)=(-)^{s_{12}+l_{12}+t_{12}}=(-)^{s_{12}^\prime+l_{12}^\prime+t_{12}^\prime}$, implemented in \texttt{main.twobody.f} for
the $\texttt{t12}\in\{0;1\}$ case as $\texttt{t12=(1-(-1)**(l12+s12+1))/2}$.

Only the last line is coded in the kernel's \texttt{2Bkernel.*.f} and
\texttt{spintricks*.f}, namely the twobody operator $\calO_{12}$ projected
onto orbital angular momenta via Clebsches.

All other lines are coded in the mantle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Radial Integrations}
\label{sec:integration-radial}

The radial integration grids are set up in \texttt{main.twobody.f}
via

\texttt{call TRNS(NP12A,NP12B,NP12,P12A,P12B,P12C,P12MAG,AP12MAG)}
\\
The $p_{12}^\prime$ integration uses the same Gau\3ian grid as the $p_{12}$
integration.
\\
They are passed down to \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f}.

\absatz
The integration over $p_{12}$ is done as sum over index \texttt{ip12} in
\texttt{main.twobody.f}, but the integrand (including weight
$p_{12}^2\texttt{AP12MAG}$) is set up in \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f}.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  $\texttt{ip12}=1,\dots,\texttt{NP12}$& index of the \texttt{NP12} points of radial integration $p_{12}$\\
  \texttt{P12MAG(ip12)}& momentum  $p_{12}$ of index \texttt{ip12}\\
  \texttt{AP12MAG(ip12)}& Gau\3ian weight of momentum  $p_{12}$ of index \texttt{ip12}
\end{tabular}

\absatz
The integration over $p_{12}^\prime$ is
done inside \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f} as sum over index \texttt{ip12p}:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  $\texttt{ip12p}=1,\dots,\texttt{NP12}$& index of the \texttt{NP12} points of radial integration $p_{12}^\prime$\\
  \texttt{P12MAG(ip12p)}& momentum  $p_{12}^\prime$ of index \texttt{ip12p}\\
  \texttt{AP12MAG(ip12p)}& Gau\3ian weight of momentum  $p_{12}^\prime$ of index \texttt{ip12p}
\end{tabular}

\absatz
The combined integrand plus permutation factor plus measure plus density plus
$\hbar c$ factor is set up in \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f} as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \texttt{fact=}&
    \underbrace{\texttt{Anucl*(Anucl-1)/2}}_{\dis\genfrac{(}{)}{0pt}{}{A}{2}}
    \underbrace{\texttt{*p12**2*wp12}}_{\dis\deint{}{p_{12}} p_{12}^{2}}\\&    \underbrace{\texttt{*P12MAG(ip12p)**2*AP12MAG(ip12p)/(2*Pi)**3}}_{\dis\frac{\deint{}{p_{12}'} p_{12}^{\prime \, 2 }}{(2\pi)^3}}\\
  &\underbrace{\texttt{*rho(ip12,ip12p,rindx)}}_
  {\dis\rho_{\alpha_{12}'\,\alpha_{12}}^{M'M} (p_{12}',p_{12};\qv)}
  \underbrace{\texttt{*HC**3.d0}}_{\dis(\hbar c)^3}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Angular Integrations}
\label{sec:integration-radial}

The angular  integration grids are set up in \texttt{main.twobody.f}
via

\texttt{call Setquad12(th12,Nth12,phi12,Nphi12,\dots)}

and passed via \texttt{finalstatesums.*.f} to \texttt{calculate2BI2.f}, where
they are performed, calling the kernel-specific file \texttt{2Bkernel.*.f}.

The integral is performed by adding iteratively to the variable
\texttt{Int(extQnum,ml12p,ml12)} the following:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \underbrace{\texttt{Yl12pstar(ml12p)}}_
    {\dis Y^{\dagger}_{l_{12}' (m_{12}' - m^{s \prime }_{12})} ( \hat p_{12}')}
    \underbrace{\texttt{*Yl12(ml12)}}_{\dis Y_{l_{12} (m_{12} - m^{s }_{12})} ( \hat p_{12})}&
 \underbrace{\texttt{*angweight12(ith,iphi)}}_
 {\dis\deint{}{\hat p_{12}}}
 \underbrace{\texttt{*angweight12(jth,jphi)}}
 _{\dis\deint{}{\hat p_{12}^\prime}}\\[2ex]&
 \underbrace{\texttt{*Kernel2B(extQnum,s12p,msp,s12,ms)}}_
 {\dis O_{12}^{\alpha_{12}'m_{12}^{s\prime} \alpha_{12}m_{12}^{s}} (\pv_{12}^{\,\prime}, \pv_{12}; \qv )}
     \end{split}
   \end{equation}
   [Strictly speaking,
   \texttt{Yl12pstar=Real(Yl12p(ml12p))-ci*Imag(Yl12p(ml12p))} is defined just
   before the summation \texttt{do extQnum=1,extQnumlimit} is done.]

   \noindent
   [\texttt{ml12=m12-ms}, \texttt{ml12p=m12p-msp}. The other quantum numbers
   should be self-explanatory.]
   
The summation is again over indices:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  $\texttt{ith}=1,\dots,\texttt{Nth12}$& index of the \texttt{Nth12} points of
                                        angular integration $\theta_{12}$\\
  $\texttt{iphi}$& index of the \texttt{Nphi12} points of
                                          angular integration $\phi_{12}$\\
  & where $\texttt{iphi=ith}$ when the Lebedev-Laikov method is used\\
  & \phantom{where} $\texttt{iphi=1,\dots,\texttt{Nphi12}}$ when Gau\3ian integrations\\&\hf
    in $\theta$ and $\phi$ separately are used\\
  \texttt{th12(ith)}& angle  $\theta_{12}$ of index \texttt{ith}\\
  \texttt{phi12(iphi)}& angle  $\phi_{12}$ of index \texttt{iphi}\\
  \texttt{angweight12(ith,iphi)}& weight of angle  $(\theta_{12},\phi_{12})$ of index (\texttt{ith},\texttt{iphi}).
\end{tabular}

\absatz
For the primed variables:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  $\texttt{jth}=1,\dots,\texttt{Nth12}$& index of the \texttt{Nth12} points of
                                        angular integration $\theta_{12}^\prime$\\
  $\texttt{jphi}$& index of the \texttt{Nphi12} points of
                                          angular integration $\phi_{12}^\prime$\\
  & where $\texttt{jphi=jth}$ when the Lebedev-Laikov method is used\\
  & \phantom{where} $\texttt{jphi=1,\dots,\texttt{Nphi12}}$ when Gau\3ian integrations\\&\hf
    in $\theta$ and $\phi$ separately are used\\
